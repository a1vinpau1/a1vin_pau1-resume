        <h1 align="center">Green Leaf Disease Detection</h1>
        <p align="justify">This project highlighted the concepts and techniques used by various researchers to identify and classify diseases, challenging issues and problems. The ultimate goal is to limit the impact of plant diseases on agricultural production using image processing techniques. Moreover, it is important to understand the correlation between the disease symptoms and its impacts on yield. It is an efficient and effective method to determine plant leaf diseases. Image processing technique enables automatic detection of diseased leaves. Our model is feasible for common people. It is an accurate and fast method. GREEN LEAF DISEASE DETECTION showcases a framework utilizing Raspberry PI to detect and prevent plant disease from spreading. Automatic detection of symptoms of the disease is useful for upgrading agricultural products. Completely automatic design and implementation of these technologies will make a significant contribution to the chemical application. The cost of pesticides and other products will be reduced. This will lead to an increase in farm productivity.</p>
