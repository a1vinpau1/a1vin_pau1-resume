        <p align="justify">The condition of plants can be continuously monitored, this will reduce the wastage of water and ensure the proper health of plants. By using a soil moisture sensor and BLYNK App we could analyse the moisture level in the soil and water the plants based on that. This can be controlled using our phone or a desktop. If the moisture level gets reduced a message to passed and the user gets a notification that the moisture level is low. The shade gets activated from 1-4 and we can control it manually based on the atmospheric temperature.</p>
